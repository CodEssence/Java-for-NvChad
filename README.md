# Java-for-NvChad
---

**This is the TEMPORARY Github repo I am going to be putting out to troubleshoot the Problem I am having with my NvChad Java Setup with the help of tech savvy community!**

- [nvim](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/tree/main/nvim) folder is a direct copy of NeoVim, more specifically **Nvchad configurations** i have in my ~/.config/ directory.

- I documented my whole set up process in [nvim.java-custom.md](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.java-custom.md) file i have.

- You can find links to my other notes related to NeoVim configuration, you're going to find this helpful: [nvim.config-plugman](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.config-plugman.md)

- You can find additional information and all the **resources** used to build this configurations in the [nvim.java-custom.md](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.java-custom.md) file.

## The Problem


- Problem i am facing is:

1. Features I configured on nvim doesnt work including:

- Syntax highlighting
- Specific Keybindings
- Treesitter
- and possibly other features...

Java files look like raw **text** files when i open them just like in this case:

## Help!

I'd be so thankful if i am able to fix my set up with the help of you, since i dont have much programming knowledge in general!

Check out my [Reddit post](update the link)!


**Feel free to request for the updates, and any assign any troubleshooting steps!**

### **Troubleshooting Update: Manual JDTLS Launch & Persistent JAR Access Error**

As part of the ongoing effort to diagnose the Java LSP issue in Neovim (NvChad), a critical troubleshooting step involved attempting to launch the JDTLS language server directly from the terminal. This was done to rule out any integration problems specific to Neovim or its plugins.

**Manual JDTLS Launch Attempt:**

The following command (or a very similar variation) was executed directly in the terminal, targeting the JDTLS launcher JAR:

```bash
java \
-Declipse.application=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.id1 \
-Dosgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel=4 \
-Declipse.product=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.product \
-Dlog.protocol=true \
-Dlog.level=ALL \
-Xms1G -Xmx2G \
-javaagent:"~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/jdtls/lombok.jar" \
-jar "~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/jdtls/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.7.0.v20250331-1702.jar" \
-configuration "~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/jdtls/config_linux" \
-data "/path/to/your/java/project" \
--add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM \
--add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
```

**Resulting Error:**

Despite all prior checks, this command consistently failed with the error:

`Error: Unable to access jarfile org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.7.0.v20250331-1702.jar`

**Key Findings & What We've Ruled Out:**

This specific error, "Unable to access jarfile," has led to extensive diagnostics:

* **File Existence & Permissions:** The `org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_*.jar` file exists at the specified path and has been confirmed to have correct read and execute permissions (even tested with `chmod 777` on the directory).
* **JAR Integrity:** The JAR file is not corrupted, as confirmed by successful extraction using the `unzip` command.
* **JVM Capability:** The `java` executable itself is functional and capable of running *other* simple `.jar` files (e.g., a "Hello World" JAR) located in the exact same directory, ruling out a general JVM issue or a broader file system access problem.
* **JDK Version:** The issue persists across different JDK versions (tested with both OpenJDK 22 and Amazon Corretto 17 via `sdkman`).
* **System Security:** Neither SELinux (not active) nor AppArmor (active but no direct profile for `java`) appear to be directly blocking the `java` command's access to the JAR.

**The Current Blockage:**

The core problem remains why the Java Virtual Machine cannot "access" or more accurately, *execute* this specific `org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_*.jar` file, despite all **filesystem**, **permission**, and **basic JAR integrity** checks appearing to be valid. This suggests a very subtle issue, possibly related to internal JVM class loading, specific characteristics of the Equinox launcher JAR, or an environmental factor not yet identified.

**Any insights from those familiar with deep JVM behavior or Eclipse Equinox would be invaluable.**
