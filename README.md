# Java-for-NvChad

**This is the TEMPORARY Github repo I am going to be putting out to troubleshoot the Problem I am having with my NvChad Java Setup with the help of tech savvy community!**

- [nvim](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/tree/main/nvim) folder is a direct copy of NeoVim, more specifically **Nvchad configurations** i have in my ~/.config/ directory.

- I documented my whole set up process in [nvim.java-custom.md](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.java-custom.md) file i have.

- You can find links to my other notes related to NeoVim configuration, you're going to find this helpful: [nvim.config-plugman](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.config-plugman.md)

- You can find additional information and all the **resources** used to build this configurations in the [nvim.java-custom.md](https://github.com/CodEssence/Java-for-NvChad/blob/main/nvim.java-custom.md) file.

- Syntax highlighting
- Specific Keybindings
- Treesitter
- and possibly other features...

Java files look like raw **text** files when i open them just like in this case:
